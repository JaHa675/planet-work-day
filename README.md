This is the function I used to change backgrounds as time goes by.

I thought I was going to really dislike this project. I don't enjoy working with CSS or bootstrap, but this one wasn't so bad. I love doing little JS puzzles, and while this one might not be a puzzle for everyone, I wanted to have the save and load be flexible. I could have finished it much faster but I spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out the syntax for saving and loading everything without creating a long series of if else or 9 separate functions. Overall, it  was pretty fun to figure out!
